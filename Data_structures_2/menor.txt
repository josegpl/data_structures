I'm in love with my favourite toy
Can't go a day without Computer Boy
I smile at him while I turn him on
I'm so happy until Computer's gone

I don't care and I won't change myself
I don't want anybody else
I fell in love with the man of the future
I've got a thing for my laptop computer
I'm so in love with the man of the future
The only one that brings me joy is my computer boy

Boy, boy
Boy, boy, boy

I'm trying not to get attached to you
But no one else gets me like you do
When you blow on my face you make me come alive
I want your floppy disk to be my hard drive

I don't care and I won't change myself
I don't want anybody else
I fell in love with the man of the future
I've got a thing for my laptop computer
I'm so in love with the man of the future
The only one that brings me joy is my computer boy

Don't ever leave me
Or go to sleep without me
Please stay by my side forever
And never talk to anyone else
My dearest
Boy, boy, boy
Computer Boy

Boy, boy
Boy, boy, boy

I don't care and I won't change myself
I don't want anybody else
No, I don't plan to change myself
To be with anybody

Computer Boy

I fell in love with the man of the future
I've got a thing for my laptop computer
I'm so in love with the man of the future
The only one that brings me joy is my Computer

I fell in love with the man of the future
I've got a thing for my laptop computer
I'm so in love with the man of the future
The only one that brings me joy is my Computer
The only one that brings me joy is my Computer
The only one that brings me joy is my Computer Boy
